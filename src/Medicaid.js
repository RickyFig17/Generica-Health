      <p>
        Medicaid is a joint federal and state health insurance program designed
        to provide free or low-cost healthcare to low-income individuals and
        families. Unlike Medicare, which is mainly for seniors, Medicaid covers
        a broader range of people, including children, pregnant women, elderly
        individuals, and people with disabilities.
      </p>
      <h3>Key Features of Medicaid:</h3>
      <ul>
        <h5>Eligibility:</h5>
        <li>
          Based on income and household size, typically determined by the

        </li>
        <li>
          Includes low-income adults, children (CHIP), pregnant women, elderly
          individuals, and people with disabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some states have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA)
          to cover more low-income adults.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>

        <li>Preventive services (vaccines, screenings)</li>
        <li>Maternity and newborn care</li>

        </li>

          Funded by both federal and state governments, with each state managing
          its own program within federal guidelines.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h5>State-Specific Programs:</h5>
        <li>Medicaid benefits and eligibility rules vary by state.</li>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h5>Enrollment:</h5>

        <li>
